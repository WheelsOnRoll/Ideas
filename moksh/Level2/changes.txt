The following changes were made apart from adding meta tags to the head.

- Enclose the title in h1 tags. This was done since search engines try to match the heading tags with the 
search query, so including the title in a h1 tag improves the search engine visibility of the site.

- Add alt attribute to images. Makes the content more accessible to search engine crawlers
